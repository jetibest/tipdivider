		Freely view the entire open source-code <a href="https://github.com/jetibest/tipdivider">on GitHub here</a>.

		All of the data entered on the website, is locally encrypted and decrypted using AES symmetric encryption by the <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge">Forge library</a>, and is therefore not readable on the server without knowing the passphrase. The passphrase is embedded in the hash segment of the URL (#...), so it will never be sent to the server. It is impossible for anyone to decrypt the data without first manipulating the source code of this app. Therefore, verify the checksum in the source code with the one on the github repository to check integrity. Unfortunately, there is not yet an universal method of automating such verification with 3rd-party websites.
		Additionally, do not ignore possible warnings of the browser about invalid SSL Certificates, it means that your connection is not secure.
